#Sentiment Analysis on Twitter

###Summary
> Base on a sample of data collected from Twitter API Version 1.1, a sentiment analysis was performed over the selected topic, "obama", using the lexical affinity approach. As a result, the average sentiment scores grouped by states across the U.S. and the states scoring the higest and lowest were returned. Each score was in the range of -5 to 5 where a greater value reflects a more positive perception and vice versa.
