#Sentiment Analysis on Twitter

###Summary
> Based on a sample of data collected from Twitter API Version 1.1, a sentiment analysis was performed over the selected topic, "obama", using the lexical affinity approach. As a result, the average sentiment scores grouped by states across the U.S. and the states scoring the higest and lowest were returned. Each score was in the range of -5 to 5 where a greater value reflects a more positive perception and vice versa. This project employed the words database "AFINN-111" which is distributed under [Open Database License (ODbL) v1.0](http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/) as the reference for the sentiment scores computation. To further explore the public's opinions on the topic, the ten most frequently called hashtags were also determined.
